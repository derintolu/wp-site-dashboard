# Portal Plugin Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. âœ… **Pages Not Selectable in Menu Configuration**
- **Problem**: The menu pages weren't loading properly in the admin interface
- **Fix**: 
  - Created custom post type `portal_page` instead of using regular WordPress pages
  - Added proper REST API support for the custom post type
  - Improved error handling in admin interface to gracefully handle missing pages
  - Added default portal pages creation on plugin activation

### 2. âœ… **Insufficient Icon Selection & SVG Upload**
- **Problem**: Limited icon options and no ability to upload custom SVGs
- **Fix**: 
  - Expanded icon library from ~15 to 80+ Gutenberg/WordPress icons
  - Added custom SVG upload functionality with media uploader integration
  - Created icon preview system
  - Added icon categories (Dashboard, E-commerce, Users, Analytics, etc.)

### 3. âœ… **Admin Interface Formatting Issues**

- **Fix**:

  - Added responsive design for mobile devices
  - Improved card-based layout with hover effects
  - Fixed spacing, typography, and component alignment
  - Added loading states and proper notices

### 4. âœ… **Theme Interference with Portal Pages**

  - Added proper reset styles and portal-specific CSS
